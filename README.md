- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lyndsay.
- ðŸ‘€ My working journey has taken me through many corners of public health research - project management, clinical research, and now observational data analysis. I worked in tobacco cessation research for many years and recently transitioned to maternal and child health epidemiology at the Washington State Department of Health. 
- ðŸŒ± I've been an R user since 2021 and dabbled in other languages (SQL, Python) as well as Tableau, ArcGIS, and PowerBI. I'm always excited to learn new tools.
